here's descriptions that chris sent me.
-db

- dbWriter.c -
A small C program that receives backlog data from stdin and parses it into an SQL database on the ARM board.

- dbReader.c -
A small C program that reads data from the database, which was inserted by dbWriter.c. The data is formatted and written to stdout. Whenever this data is read and subsequently written to stdout the index of the last read entry in the database is placed into another SQL table called LATESTQUERY. The purpose of this is to ensure we don't re-process the same data on subsequent reads.

- frpprocess.py -
This script is responsible for sending the files via FTP by issuing AT commands to the modem via serial connection. The script is passed a file for sending via command line argument.

- ftpcomm.py -
This script acts is a wrapper to the ftpprocess.py script. This was more of an experiment than anything. Occasionally there would be a hang when sending data over the cellular network and I needed a way to kill the send process and be able to restart again. This script enabled this and placed any failed files into a separate directory so they could be retried.
